# Milvus-Documentation

This is a collection of all the notes and files associated with my process in familiarizing myself with the Milvus Vector Database. Any questions can be mailed directly to me at chantal.zhang2015@gmail.com. 

About me: I'm Chantal, a first year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, working with masters student Enan Ajmain to create the backend of a dashboard. This dashboard will take in error messages, convert them into vectors, and store them within Milvus so that similarity searches can be performed on the data.
